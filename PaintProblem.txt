A room will be painted
The room has no windows, no door
Only the walls and ceiling will be painted, not the floor.

Write a Python program to:
Ask the user for the room's width
Ask the user for the room's height
Ask the user for the room's length
Ask the user for the coverage in squared meters, of a liter of paint.
The program will output how much paint is needed to paint the room.
